# Takeaways

- **DOM**: Document Object Model. Representation of objects that make up the structure of a web document.
	- Document is represented as a tree of nodes and objects.
	- **Node**: An object with properties and methods.
		- The document, elements, text, and comments.
- HTML code parsed by browser -> Converted to the DOM.
- **Query selector**: Uses CSS-style selectors to target nodes and returns corresponding references.
- **Events**: Actions that occur on the webpage.
	- Add event listeners/handlers to react to these events.
	- **Callbacks**: Functions passed into other functions as arguments.

During the workings of my first code in JavaScript, I wanted modularity and structure, thus turning 
to classes to encapsulate this project's data. However, upon its completion, I felt OOP principles 
were not as relevant in this context, having yet to study the common design patterns in modern JavaScript 
code: Javascript objects and object constructors, factory functions and the module pattern, ES6 
modules, and of course, JS classes. In the future, I hope to return to this project, possibly 
refactoring the code after learning important JavaScript concepts.

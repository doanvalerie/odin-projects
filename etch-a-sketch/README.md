# Takeaways

During the workings of my second code in JavaScript, I wanted modularity and structure, thus turning 
to classes to encapsulate this project's data. However, upon its completion, I felt OOP principles 
were not as relevant in this context, having yet to study the common design patterns in modern JavaScript 
code: Javascript objects and object constructors, factory functions and the module pattern, ES6 
modules, and of course, JS classes. In the future, I hope to return to this project, possibly 
refactoring the code after learning important JavaScript concepts.
